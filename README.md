This is the web dev project I am building in my second year of CS major.  It mostly used HTML and CSS, with some twigs of javascript being used here and there. 
The baisc problem statement of this project was that in todays day and age we have to depend upon various offline / online vendors scattered around various places to book any event or any party which you wish to have. 
There is no one place where you can get all of this, you need to call 10 different people for catering , venue were the event will be held , dj will haave to be booked seperalty , the vallet management if you are booking in an open place.
All of this is a hastle which can be coped if they are all interlinked and the event manager is a common person under which all these fields fall. So we have have created a one-in-all website which is called "Make-all-stops". 
Inititaly we have made the portal for 3 events which are office events , bithday parties , weddings since these are the one which require the most of the interlinking of all the above jobs.
